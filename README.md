# PokerToolbox

This provides a set of utilities for easily representing and evaluating situations in a poker game.
It is designed to optimize frequent calculations to enable real-time processing of a poker game.
This can be embedded into any application as desired. 
The designed use case is for back-end evaluation of a gamestate that would be communicated with a web-based front-end.
Given this, there are a handful of methods for conveniently serializing and de-serializing the gamestate via JSON. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'poker_toolbox'
